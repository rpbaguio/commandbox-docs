# Installation

Regardless of where you place the **box** binary, the first time you execute it, a `.CommandBox` folder will be created in your user's home directory and CommandBox will be extracted into that location. If you delete this directory, it will be replaced the next time the CommandBox executable is run.

You can specify a different install location by adding `-commandbox_home=E:\CommandBox` when you run the box binary.

To avoid specifying the commandbox\_home variable every time you can create a file called `commandbox.properties` \(case sensitive\) in the same directory as the binary, and fill it with this line:

```bash
commandbox_home=E:\\CommandBox
```

##  Windows

Unzip the executable **box.exe** and just double click on it to open the shell. When you are finished running commands, you can just close the window, or type `exit`.

> **Hint** You can make the `box.exe` available in any Windows terminal by adding its location to the `PATH` system environment variable. See [http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm](http://www.computerhope.com/issues/ch000549.htm)

##  Mac/  \*Unix

### Homebrew \(Mac\)

[Homebrew](http://brew.sh) is a great Mac package manager, it can easily install and keep your CommandBox installation up to date \(even binary releases\), just run the following for stable releases:

```bash
brew install commandbox
```

To stay with current bleeding edge releases use the following:

```bash
brew tap ortus-solutions/boxtap
brew tap-pin ortus-solutions/boxtap
brew install --devel commandbox
```

Then run the `box` binary to begin the one-time unpacking process.

Versions will be installed in `/usr/local/Cellar/commandbox`. To switch between versions, simply use `brew switch commandbox [version number]`

### Manual Installation

Unzip the binary **box** and just double click on it to open the shell terminal. When you are finished running commands, you can just close the window, or type `exit`.
